> [Multiliteracies in algorithms](http://compositionforum.com/issue/14.2/rev-selber.php): functional literacy, critical literacy, and rhetorical literacy.
Within critical literacy, a strong emphasis will be knowing what is possible. For algorithms, this
usually means *computational complexity* -- the study of how the time needed to perform an algorithm
grows as the problem size (e.g., the number of data) grows. For algorithms dealing with data, we will study how
this leads to a balance between *fast* and *accurate*. Within functional literacy, we will be building on
Python's tools for learning from data, including [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/). Rhetorical literacy will be the anchor
for the class, as our primary interest is in producing technology-enabled journalism.

### Monday 8/4 

opening questions:

+ how can journalists be disciplined while facing deadlines?
    - hard with deadlines; cf., "[The Goat Must Be Fed](http://www.goatmustbefed.com/): Why digital tools are missing in most newsrooms", by the Duke Reporters' Lab, May 2014 
    - hard even for professional developers; cf., [commit logs from last night](http://commitlogsfromlastnight.com/ )
    - growing awareness is already leading to novel field, and novel curricula. cf., the [software carpentry]( http://software-carpentry.org/ ) movement.
    - note that you ignore good software carpentry at your peril. cf., ["
  How to lose $172,222 a second for 45 minutes"]( http://pythonsweetness.tumblr.com/post/64740079543/how-to-lose-172-222-a-second-for-45-minutes )
+ should the relationship between journalist and story end when story is published?  (cf., "[The leaked New York Times innovation report](http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/05/the-leaked-new-york-times-innovation-report-is-one-of-the-key-documents-of-this-media-age/) is one of the key documents of this media age", Joshua Benton, Neiman Journalism Lab )

with readers into new stories

        - functional literacy
        - critical literacy: does choice of centrality matter?

deep thoughts/tangents:

- data journalism is not qualitatively different from other journalism. they're both awesome because they involve thinking clearly. they're both limited by subjective choices, including design choices and process choices. 
- great quote related to the above, from [a post](http://civilstat.com/?p=1436) by a stats [grad student](http://civilstat.com/?page_id=5) about [a MOOC](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/node/14149/) on data driven journalism.
